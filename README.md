🔍 Key Findings

The average MRR growth (6.75) is less than half of the industry benchmark (15).

Growth is inconsistent, with a drop in Q2 followed by partial recovery in Q3/Q4.

Current trajectory shows declining competitiveness against industry peers.

The business is not scaling fast enough to meet investor expectations.

📉 Business Implications

Slowing revenue growth impacts cash flow, hiring plans, and product investments.

Competitive SaaS companies with 15+% growth gain customer mindshare faster.

Marketing & sales efficiency is below expected standard.

🚀 Recommendation

To reach the industry target of 15% MRR growth, the company must:

➡️ Expand into new market segments

This includes:

Launching tailored pricing for SMBs/enterprises

Localizing the product for new geographies

Building partnerships in underserved industries

Creating add-on features for upselling
